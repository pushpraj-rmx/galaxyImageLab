										   <h2>ULTRASOUND </h2>
										    <br>
                                            <h2>What is an ultrasound Scan?</h2>
											<p>Ultrasound is a procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to view internal organs and produce images of the human body. Ultrasound is: Noninvasive, which means it does not penetrate the skin or body openings and Diagnostic which means it is used to determine what disease or condition is present The technical term for ultrasound imaging is sonography. The original ultrasound scanners produced still images, but modern scanners produce moving pictures, which are easier to interpret.</p>
											
											<h2>What are the benefits of getting Ultrasound done?</h2>
											 <p>One of the most common uses for ultrasound is to view the uterus (the muscular organ in a woman’s abdomen that holds the fetus) and fetus (unborn child) during pregnancy. Ultrasound scanning is often performed at about 16 to 18 weeks into the pregnancy. An ultrasound can provide a view of the:</p>

                                                    	<li>pancreas</li>

                                                      	<li>testicles</li>
                                                      	<li>uterus</li>
											  </ul>
											  
											   <h2> Is there any risk involved in Ultrasound ?</h2>
											   <p>Ultrasound is considered a safe process because, unlike X rays, it does not involve ionising radiation.It just comprises of harmless ultrasonic sound waves .</P>
											   
											   <h2>Who will perform my scan?</h2>
											   <p>Ultrasound scans are performed by experienced radiologist.</p>
											   
											   <h2>What is TVS Ultrasound?</h2>
											   <p>It is a sonography done for better visualisation of uterus & ovaries. A high-resolution endovaginal probe is inserted into the vagina for this examination. It is not painful. It is done as a routine at our centre by female radiologists  as it is observed that at times, even fairly prominent lesions can be missed if only trans-abdominal sonography is performed. It does not require a full bladder.

                                                 </p>
												 <h2>Which machine you have for carrying out Ultrasound investigation?</h2>
												 <p>have latest & hi tech 5D-Ultrasound machine (i.e. HS70A) from SAMSUNG Company which is the most high resolution ultrasound unit with special features such as live 5D view of the fetus , 5d view of the uterus (very helpful in diagnosis of infertility usually missed by other ultrasound machines ) and 5d Doppler for very minor Doppler abnormalities a s well . We also have  high resolution 4d machine H60 by Samsung . Along with the machine there is broad range of transducers designed especially to meet the needs of the patients.
                                                 Extraordinary images. Specialized systems. Innovative solutions. Samsung  ultrasound imaging systems are designed to give the clarity, performance, flexibility, efficiency, and adaptability you need—with a range of innovative options to help meet all your clinical needs.

					<h2>HEMATOLOGY AND CLINICAL PATHOLOGY</h2>
					  <p ><span style="color:blue;">In view of meeting the  aim of providing accurate, reliable and quick services to its valued customers, specially developed computer software is  installed in the laboratory thus providing accuracy in data transfer,  control , retrieval  and monitoring, thereby preventing manual errors. </span>  </p>
                           <br>
						   
						   <p>Galaxy path labs have found way to integrate <b>bar-coding system</b >which is a method of automated data collection. It is a way to rapidly, efficiently and accurately gather information and transmit it to a computer.  It is a series of black bars with intervening white spaces which are used to represent letters and/or numerals. These lab labels are able to handle extreme conditions such as cryogenic storage or rigorous chemicals, stains and solvents. It has a firm adhesive hold up, so that printed information which conveys critical product, patient or testing information is not lost.</p>

								 <p>GALAXY PATH LABS has ‘state of art’ Biochemistry lab with latest instruments and well trained staff. All the equipment are bidirectional interfaced to avoid human transcription errors</p>
								 
								 <h2>MICROBILOGY AND SEROLOGY.</h2>
								 <p>Both the sections have dedicated staff well trained in their work. The staff is committed towards quality assurance of every report and stringently follows the quality assurance program of the lab. The entire work is supervised by dedicated Microbiologists</p>
								 
								 <h2>CYTOLOGY</h2>
								 <p>Cytopathology is study of cells and is commonly used to investigate diseases involving a wide range of body sites, often to aid in the diagnosis of cancer, but also in the diagnosis of some infectious diseases and other inflammatory conditions.</p> 
								 
								 
								 <h4 style="color:blue;">•	Interventional Cytology</h4>
								 <p><b>Interventional Cytology</b> i.e; <b>Fine-needle aspiration</b> (FNAC), performed by a pathologist or radiologist which involves usage of a needle attached to a syringe to collect cells from lesions or swellings in various body organs often with the application of negative pressure (suction) to increase yield.
                                FNAC can be performed under palpation guidance (i.e., the clinician can feel the lesion) in superficial regions like the neck, thyroid or breast ;
                                It may be also be assisted by ultrasound  for sampling of deep-seated non palpable lesions within the body.</P>
								
								<h4 style="color:blue;">•	Exfoliative Cytology</h4>
								<p><b>Exfoliative cytology</b> is a common application of cytopathology which includes <b> Pap smear/Liquid based cytology ,</b> a screening tool used to detect precancerous cervical lesions which may lead to cervical cancer.
                                In this method, cells are collected after they have been manually scraped/brushed from the cervix with a spatula or brush .
